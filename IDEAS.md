## Shared Context

Inject context from one session into another.

Possible approaches:
- Export conversation summary to a file, import into another session
- Shared 9p file that multiple sessions can read from
- Command to "copy context" between sessions via the orchestrator
- Named context snippets that can be referenced by any session
